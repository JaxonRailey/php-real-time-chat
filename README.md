# How does a chat work?

Instant messaging systems have replaced the SMS, in this repo what's under the hood of a chat. This very simple example makes use of websocket, a particular software object that deals with the transport of information between the various clients.

All code is pure PHP / JS / HTML / CSS.

To execute the server process, execute this instruction in the terminal:

```php
php server.php
```

Optionally you can add a parameter that indicates the port on which to make the socket work, by default 3000.

Once the server has started, reach the index.html from the browser, choose the username and avatar to start chatting.

Enjoy!
